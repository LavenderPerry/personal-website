# My Girlfriend is Really Weird (By the way I love her)

* personal
* queer
* rambling

I was in the middle of writing a different blog post[^1] while talking to my lovely girlfriend (her name is Luna), when she decided to be cringe. To be clear, cringe is not necessarily a bad thing. People are often unfairly shunned and labeled as cringe for having harmless hobbies or traits, especially if they are neurodivergent. Nobody should be belittled for cringe, and I have no intention to insult Luna in this post. However, I am going to (with Luna's enthusiastic encouragement) post some of her cringe here because it is funny. Think of this post as being through the perspective of a very confused admirer.

## Fanfiction Reading Habits

Luna has a peculiar taste in literature. She primarily reads fanfictions of lesbian ships in the game *Genshin Impact*. Likely the most unhinged fanfiction she tried to get me to read is an "Omegaverse" fanfiction of the ship Eula x Amber, or Eulamber. If you did not understand the meaning of that sentence, you are normal. Leave while you still can[^2]. Honestly, I do not understand what Omegaverse is either, but from what Luna told me, I have no desire to understand it any further. Regardless of my repulsion from Omegaverse, the request "Read the Eulamber fic" haunts my consciousness. To engage in a conversation with Luna void of this plea is rarer than getting a character in a *Genshin Impact* wish[^3]. Another eccentricity of Luna's AO3[^4] history is her tendency of, to put it bluntly, reading pornography for the plot. There is the chance she is lying because she feels embarrassed about it, but I know her well. Luna would not get embarrassed or lie about these things. She genuinely enjoys the story.

## Food Crimes

Moving on, the culinary catastrophies this woman has dragged me kicking and screaming through are too numerous to count. Luna loves to engage in a ritual coloquially known as "girldinner". Her latest abomination of a meal is peanut butter straight out of the jar. Now, Luna is not culinarily challenged by any means. She is an excellent baker and chef, and even baked me a wonderful cake for my birthday. She does not eat like this from ignorance or lack of talent -- she does so by choice. Even more improbably, Luna remains in good health while doing this. As her health is acceptable, I cannot tell her to stop. All I can do is watch in horror, as she gourges upon snacks I would not dare touch.

## Her Desire to be Written About in this Post (Luna calls this narcissism)

Reading what I have written so far, you may think I am being too harsh on Luna. After all, none of her quirks harm anyone, and learning about her peculiarities only makes me love her more. Indeed, I would not have written this post at all had it not been for one person. You guessed it... Luna. She was so desperate to be included in my blog that she *wanted* me to insult her. Currently, Luna is happily giggling as she watches me write, going so far as to suggest word choices and ideas. Although I appreciate her help greatly, my next post will probably have less interference from her.

## Conclusion

My girlfriend certainly has her quirks, just like anyone else. She is also extremely kind, sweet, smart, knowledgable on very niche topics, good at making me laugh, and I love her. Another thanks to Luna for making me write this blog post and proofreading it. Thank you for reading this blog post, I hope it was not too unhinged. I'm not going to have conclusions like this for every post, but seeing as this is my first one, I thought it was appropriate.

Telling people to subscribe me feel like one of those loser youtuber wannabes[^5]... I'm not gonna do that again.
