<h1>Projects</h1>
<div><p>Most of my projects these days are video games / creative, interactive stuff, but that is reflected more by my academic work than what I have online.  To protect my privacy, my academic work will not be posted online until after I graduate, but if we have chatted before, you are welcome to ask to see it.</p></div>
