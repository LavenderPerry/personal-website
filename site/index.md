## Other acknowledgements

This section is for any people, projects, and/or resources that I used to make
this website which are not already covered by the buttons above.

At some point I will add a font to this website,
the font I use will be acknowledged here.

In addition to the [Soupault website](https://soupault.app),
[its source code](https://github.com/PataphysicalSociety/soupault.app)
was helpful for learning to make this website.
