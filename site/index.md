## Buttons

Please [ask me](/contact) first before putting my button on your own website!
Here is the HTML to do so.

```html
<a href="https://lavender.nekoweb.org">
    <img src="https://lavender.nekoweb.org/buttons/lavender.png" alt="Lavender">
</a>
```

Alternatively you may download the image and host it on your own server.
That is what I do for all the buttons on this website.

this website which are not already covered by the buttons above.

I write all the pages on this website in Markdown, and convert it to HTML using
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org).

At some point I will add a font to this website,
the font I use will be acknowledged here.

In addition to the [Soupault website](https://soupault.app),
