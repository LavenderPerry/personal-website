Welcome to my website! I'm Lavender.
Use the navigation box to explore the website, or continue reading this page.

## About Me

--------- -------------------
full name Lavender Nova Perry
pronouns   she/her, they/them
--------- -------------------

I like to play rugby, write, make art, and make/play games.

## Buttons

All buttons are clickable
and take you to their source / the relevant website for them.

The first button I made myself.
The rest are related to things about me and this website.

Please [ask me](/contact) first before putting my button on your own website!
Here is the HTML to do so.

```html
<a href="https://lavender.nekoweb.org">
    <img src="https://lavender.nekoweb.org/buttons/lavender.png" alt="Lavender">
</a>
```

Alternatively you may download the image and host it on your own server.
That is what I do for all the buttons on this website.

## Other acknowledgements

This section is for any people, projects, and/or resources that I used to make
this website which are not already covered by the buttons above.

At some point I will add a font to this website,
the font I use will be acknowledged here.

In addition to the [Soupault website](https://soupault.app),
[its source code](https://github.com/PataphysicalSociety/soupault.app)
was helpful for learning to make this website.
